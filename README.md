# Hytools
Hytools is a forge mod that adds useful client sided features to make the experience better on Hypixel. It uses OneConfig to manage toggling certain tools.

### PartyGuess

A tool that looks at chat and guesses if players are partied together. PartyGuess also checks if the first player in that party is in a guild with anyone else in the party. This tool works about **73%** of the time. This could fail if Hypixel decides to join everyone at the same time.

**NickAlert**

A tool that alerts if someone joined is nicked. This tool **will not reveal the person** behind the nick, but will just send it in chat. This tool will work half the time. (uses mc api) NickAlertHypixelAPI has been removed due to the api rework.

**/scanfornicks**

This command takes all the players currently in the game and scans if they are nicked. It is recommended to scan right before the game starts as NPCs in the game will be scanned too.

## üìú Translations

We have a [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/slimefunaddon) for translations. You can also submit translations here on GitHub, but Crowdin is preferred since it makes it much easier to resolve issues.

## üíæ Installation

Use the mod at your own risk. (this applies to all mods for hypixel) All chat messages from this mod is up to the player's interpretation of it.

 1. Download [Forge 1.8.9](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html) or have a client like Feather/Lunar/etc. that supports forge mods.
 2. Download the latest version of Hytools [here](https://github.com/udu3324/Hytools/releases/latest).
 3. Place the jar file into your mods' folder. (.minecraft/mods)
 4. Ta-da! Hytools is installed.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build From Source

If you want to build your own jar of Hytools, you can!

 1. Make sure you have Java Development Kit 8 Installed.
 2. [Clone](https://github.com/udu3324/Hytools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) the repository.
 3. Extract the zip.
 4. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the repository. (`cd` on windows)
 5. Run `gradlew build` or `.\gradlew build` depending on your OS.
 6. The artifacts should now be in the `/build/libs` folder
 7. (optional) Set up a dev workflow by opening the repo in Intellij (sorry vsc users) and run Intellij MC Run Config to start minecraft with the mod. Add [ReAuth](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/reauth/files/4407996) to `/run/mods` to allow logging into Hypixel.
